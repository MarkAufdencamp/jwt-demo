Task: Implement Authenticated Profile Endpoint
Summary: Implemented the /profile endpoint which returns the current authenticated user's data. Refined ApplicationController to return 401 Unauthorized for invalid tokens and to set @current_user.
Changes:
- Created app/controllers/profile_controller.rb
- Created test/controllers/profile_controller_test.rb
- Updated app/controllers/application_controller.rb
- Updated config/routes.rb
Why: To provide a demonstration of a protected resource that requires a valid JWT for access.
